# The Increment and Decrement Operator
---
Other mathematical assignment operators include the _increment operator_ (`++`) and _decrement operator_ (`--`).

The increment operator will increase the value of the variable by 1. The decrement operator will decrease the value of the variable by 1. For example:

	let a = 10;
	a++;
	console.log(a); // Output: 11

	let b = 20;
	b--;
	console.log(b); // Output: 19

Just like the previous mathematical assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`), the variable’s value is updated _and_ assigned as the new value of that variable.

To do:
1. Using the increment operator, increase the value of `gainedDollar`.
2. Using the decrement operator, decrease the value of `lostDollar`.

Editor content:

	let gainedDollar = 3;
	let lostDollar = 50;  

	gainedDollar++;
	lostDollar--;
