# Getting Started with Full-Stack Engineering

## Review

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to introduce you to the field of software engineering before diving into the technical parts of the track.

Having completed this unit, you are now able to:

-   Define what programming is
-   Understand what a software engineer does in their job
-   The difference between front-end and back-end engineering (and full-stack!)

Learning is social. Whatever you’re working on, be sure to connect with the Codecademy community in the [forums](https://discuss.codecademy.com/).
