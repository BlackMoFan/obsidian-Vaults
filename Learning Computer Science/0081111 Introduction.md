# Introduction
---
In this lesson, we’ll alter the website running on the right that animates the word Codecademy.

The tools that you will use and concepts we’ll cover provide a high-level overview of how websites and web applications work, as well as the uses of JavaScript, the language that you will be learning throughout this Path!

To do:
1. Move your mouse over “Codecademy” in the preview window. Pretty cool!
	
	Press Run when you are ready to continue.

2. Let’s change this page so that it displays the word “JavaScript” rather than “Codecademy”.
	
	In line 1 of main.js, write the word “JavaScript” within quotes like this:

	```
	var wordToDisplay = "JavaScript";
	```
	
	This changes the value of the `wordToDisplay` variable from “Codecademy” to “JavaScript”.
	
	If you don’t know what this means, don’t worry! There will be a lesson that covers this material later!
	
	After making this change, run your code.
