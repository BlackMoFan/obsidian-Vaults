# Loops

---
A _loop_ is a programming tool that repeats a set of instructions until a specified condition, called a _stopping condition_ is reached. As a programmer, you’ll find that you rely on loops all the time! You’ll hear the generic term _iterate_ when referring to loops; iterate simply means “to repeat”.

When we need to reuse a task in our code, we often bundle that action in a function. Similarly, when we see that a process has to repeat multiple times in a row, we write a loop. Loops allow us to create efficient code that automates processes to make scalable, manageable programs.

As illustrated in the diagram, loops iterate or repeat an action until a specific condition is met. When the condition is met, the loop stops and the computer moves on to the next part of the program.

Check out the diagram to see how loops work in programming.
