# From Websites to Web Applications
---
As the internet got more and more advanced, we started to see websites with rich user experiences and interactivity that mimicked the behavior of desktop software applications.

Eventually, we started referring to these websites as web applications. This started around 2005, with applications like Gmail.

Though the differences can be a bit blurry in practice, here are some key characteristics that often separate a web application from a website:

-   Interactive user interfaces
-   Ability to persist data from one visit to the next
-   Front-end interfaces that can update without needing to make a request to the server on every click

On the right is _Jammming_, a music player web application that you will build later in this course.

The preview on the right isnâ€™t interactive, but when you build this project yourself, your application will be fully clickable and interactive!
