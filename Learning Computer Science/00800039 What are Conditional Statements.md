# What are Conditional Statements
---
In life, we make decisions based on circumstances. Think of an everyday decision as mundane as falling asleep — if we are tired, we go to bed, otherwise, we wake up and start our day.

These if-else decisions can be modeled in code by creating _conditional statements_. A conditional statement checks a specific condition(s) and performs a task based on the condition(s).

In this lesson, we will explore how programs make decisions by evaluating conditions and introduce logic into our code!

We’ll be covering the following concepts:

-   `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements
-   comparison operators
-   logical operators
-   truthy vs falsy values
-   ternary operators
-   `switch` statement

So _if_ you’re ready to learn these concepts go to the next lesson— _else_, read over the concepts, observe the diagram, and prepare yourself for this lesson!
