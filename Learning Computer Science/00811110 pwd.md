# pwd
---
The next command we’re going to look at is `pwd`, which stands for “print working directory.” It outputs the name of the directory you are currently in, called the _working directory_.

Here the working directory is **blog/**. In Codecademy courses, your working directory is usually inside the **/home/ccuser/workspace/** directory.

Together with `ls`, the `pwd` command is useful to show where you are in the filesystem.

To do:
1. Let’s continue with more commands. In the terminal, print the working directory.
2. List all files and directories in the working directory.
