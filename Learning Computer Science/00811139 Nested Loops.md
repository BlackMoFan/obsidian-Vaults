# Nested Loops

---
When we have a loop running inside another loop, we call that a _nested loop_. One use for a nested `for` loop is to compare the elements in two arrays. For each round of the outer `for` loop, the inner `for` loop will run completely.

Let’s look at an example of a nested `for` loop:

	const myArray = [6, 19, 20];  
	const yourArray = [19, 81, 2];  
	for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {  
		 for (let j = 0; j < yourArray.length; j++) {  
			 if (myArray[i] === yourArray[j]) {  
				 console.log('Both loops have the number: ' + yourArray[j])  
		 }  
	 }  
	};

Let’s think about what’s happening in the nested loop in our example. For each element in the outer loop array, `myArray`, the inner loop will run in its entirety comparing the current element from the outer array, `myArray[i]`, to each element in the inner array, `yourArray[j]`. When it finds a match, it prints a string to the console.

Now it’s your turn to write a nested loop!

Note: To exit out of an infinite loop in an exercise, refresh the page - then fix the code for your loop(s).

To do:
1. Imagine you’re a big-wig programmer for a social media platform! You have been tasked with building a prototype for a mutual followers program. You’ll need two arrays of “friends” from two mock users so that you can extract the names of the followers who exist in both lists. Make a variable called `bobsFollowers` and set it equal to an array with four strings representing the names of Bob’s friends.
2. Make a variable called `tinasFollowers` and set it equal to an array with three strings representing the names of Tina’s friends. Make exactly two of these the same as two of the friends in the `bobsFollowers` array.
3. Create a third variable named `mutualFollowers` and set it to an empty array.
4. Create a nested loop that iterates through `bobsFollowers` as the array for the outer loop and `tinasFollowers` as the array for the inner loop. If the current element from the outer loop is the same as the current element from the inner loop, push that element into the `mutualFollowers` array.

	// Write your code below
	let bobsFollowers = ['Bobby', 'Booba', 'Bober', 'Bobest'];

	let tinasFollowers = ['Bobby', 'Bober', 'Bobber'];

	let mutualFollowers = [];

	for(let i = 0; i < bobsFollowers.length; i++){
	  for(let j = 0; j < tinasFollowers.length; j++){
		if(bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j]){
		  mutualFollowers.push(bobsFollowers[i]);
		}
	  }
	}

	console.log(mutualFollowers);
