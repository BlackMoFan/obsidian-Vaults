# Challenge Project - Number Guesser

---
#### Overview

This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

#### Project Goals

In this project, you’ll write JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game. Your code will run in the browser instead of just the terminal, but you have an output section to help you test your functions and show you if you have syntax errors.

#### Setup Instructions

If you choose to do this project on your computer instead of Codecademy, you can download what you’ll need by clicking the “Download” button below. You’ll need to open and work in **script.js** in a text editor, and open **index.html** in a browser to test your code. If you need help setting up on your own computer, read our [article about setting up a text editor for web development](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/visual-studio-code).

To do:
**Prerequisites**
1. In order to complete this project, you should have completed the first 3 sections of [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-javascript) (through Learn JavaScript: Functions).
2. In this project, you’ll write four functions in **script.js**. We’ve provided some additional JavaScript code in **game.js** that will call your functions based on user interactions, but you don’t need to look at **game.js** and shouldn’t edit it if you want your project to work as intended. As you complete this project, make sure that all of your functions are named exactly as specified so that they can be called correctly when the game is played.
	
	This JavaScript project is probably different from most of the ones you’ve completed at Codecademy. Instead of just seeing text output from your program, your JavaScript functions are incorporated into a website that also uses HTML/CSS. You’ll learn more about how to do this from scratch as you continue your JavaScript journey.
