# Attributes
---
If we want to expand an element’s tag, we can do so using an _attribute_. Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be used in several different ways, from providing information to changing styling. Attributes are made up of the following two parts:

-   The _name_ of the attribute
-   The _value_ of the attribute

One commonly used attribute is the `id`. We can use the `id` attribute to specify different content (such as `<div>`s) and is really helpful when you use an element more than once. `id`s have several different purposes in HTML, but for now, we’ll focus on how they can help us identify content on our page.

When we add an `id` to a `<div>`, we place it in the opening tag:

	<div id="intro">
		<h1>Introduction</h1>
	</div>
