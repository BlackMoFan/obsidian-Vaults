# Review Functions
---
Give yourself a pat on the back, you just navigated through functions!

In this lesson, we covered some important concepts about functions:

-   A _function_ is a reusable block of code that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.
    
-   A _function declaration_ :

-   A parameter is a named variable inside a function’s block which will be assigned the value of the argument passed in when the function is invoked:

-   To _call_ a function in your code:

-   ES6 introduces new ways of handling arbitrary parameters through _default parameters_ which allow us to assign a default value to a parameter in case no argument is passed into the function.
    
-   To return a value from a function, we use a _return statement_.
    
-   To define a function using _function expressions_:

-   To define a function using _arrow function notation_:

-   Function definition can be made concise using concise arrow notation:

It’s good to be aware of the differences between function expressions, arrow functions, and function declarations. As you program more in JavaScript, you’ll see a wide variety of how these function types are used.
