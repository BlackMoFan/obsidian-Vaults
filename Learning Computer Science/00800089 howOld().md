# howOld()
---
Initial Editor content:

	// Write your function here:


	// Once your function is written, write function calls to test your code!

To do:
1. Write a function, `howOld()`, that has two number parameters, `age` and `year`, and returns how old someone who is currently that `age` was (or will be) during that `year`. Handle three different cases:

	-   If the year is in the future, you should return a string in the following format:

		```
		'You will be [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'
		```

	-   If the year is before they were born, you should return a string in the following format:

		```
		'The year [year passed in] was [calculated number of years] years before you were born'
		```

	-   If the year is in the past but not before the person was born, you should return a string in the following format:

		```
		'You were [calculated age] in the year [year passed in]'
		```

Final Editor content:

	// Write your function here:
	let howOld = (age, year) => {
	  let yearOfBirth = 2021 - age;
	  if(year > 2021){
		return `You will be ${year - yearOfBirth} in the year ${year}`;
	  } else if(year < 2021 && year < yearOfBirth){
		return `The year ${year} was ${yearOfBirth - year} years before you were born`;
	  } else if(year < 2021 && year > yearOfBirth){
		return `You were ${year - yearOfBirth} in the year ${year}`;
	  } else {
		return "Invalid input.";
	  }
	}


	// Once your function is written, write function calls to test your code!
	console.log(howOld(20, 2040));
	console.log(howOld(20, 2002));
	console.log(howOld(20, 1985));
