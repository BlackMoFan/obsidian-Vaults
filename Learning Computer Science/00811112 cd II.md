# cd II
---
Instead of using `cd` twice in order to move from **2015** to **memory**, we can use it once and give it a longer argument:

```
$ cd jan/memory
```

To navigate directly to a directory, use `cd` with the directory’s path as an argument. Here, `cd jan/memory` navigates directly to the **memory** directory.

To move up one directory, we use `cd ..`:

```
$ cd ..
```

Here, `cd ..` navigates up from **jan/memory/** to **jan/**.

To do:
1. We should be in **/home/ccuser/workspace/blog** (you can check your location at any time using `pwd`). If this is not the case, navigate back to **blog** before starting.
	
	Change the directory to the **2015/feb/** directory using:

	```
	$ cd 2015/feb
	```
	
	This brings us down one level to **2015** and then down once more into the **feb** directory.

2. Now we’re in **2015/feb**, but what if we want to move to **2015/jan**? (You can reference the filesystem for this lesson [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/learn-command-line/img/LCL-fileTrees-01.png).)
	
	This means that we have to go back up one level (to **2015**), and then down into the **jan** directory. This could be accomplished using two distinct `cd` commands (one that moves us up and then another that moves us back down), but we’re going to do it using just one command.
	
	Using a single `cd` command, navigate from **2015/feb** to **2015/jan**.

3. Navigate back to **/home/ccuser/workspace/blog** using a single `cd` command.
