## Welcome to the Full-Stack Engineer Path
See what you’ll learn in the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path.

Welcome to the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path! In this path, you will encounter all of the major technologies that a full-stack developer should know. You will gain a foundation in JavaScript programming, be able to use front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, React, and build secure back-ends with Node/Express and PostgreSQL. We’ll also make sure to prepare you for the infamous technical interviews you’ll encounter once you begin your job hunt.

### Learning Objectives

After this Path, you will be able to:

-   Set up your own dev environment and version control your work with Git/GitHub
-   Write client-side and server-side JavaScript code
-   Create static, responsive websites with HTML/CSS
-   Use the popular React front-end framework, along with Redux
-   Build Node/Express back-ends
-   Design and build PostgreSQL databases
-   Connect a front-end to a back-end for a full-stack PERN application
-   Implement best security practices to prevent attacks
-   Pass a JavaScript whiteboard interview

### Projects

You will demonstrate your knowledge in several Portfolio Projects that exist throughout the Path. Portfolio Projects are projects that you build on your own computer, following a set of requirements. Each one will be unique to your personal vision and set of interests. You can complete the Portfolio Projects either in parallel with or after taking the prerequisite content—it’s up to you!

Here’s a preview of the projects featured in this Path:

Mixed Messages

-   Build a Node.js console app that generates random messages each time a user runs the program and version your project with Git/GitHub

Personal Portfolio Project

-   Use HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages to build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share your other projects

Reddit Client

-   Use JavaScript, React, Redux, and the Reddit API, build an online forum containing real-life data

E-Commerce Site (two parts)

-   Over the course of two parts, build a full-stack web app where users can purchase products using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node)

Open-Ended Project

-   Use everything you’ve learned in the path to build an app of your choosing

### Curated Content

Throughout this path you may see some items that aren’t made by the Codecademy team. We’ve included these to ensure that you learn all the topics you need to get your career started. Though we didn’t write them, we’ve vetted them ourselves for technical accuracy and good teaching practices. When possible, we’ve written relevant assessments so that you can check your understanding back on our platform.

### Updates

Since we strive to bring you the best and most up-to-date content, we will be periodically updating the materials in this path. For smaller updates we’ll be communicating changes via the [Web Development Change Log](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/change-log-web-development), which features updates and bug fixes across all Web Development content. For larger changes, we’ll write a [blog post](https://news.codecademy.com/tag/updates/) detailing the extent of those changes and how they impact the syllabi. If you are enrolled in this path, we’ll send a notification each time there’s been an update, so you know exactly what has changed.

We’re excited for you to begin this journey!
