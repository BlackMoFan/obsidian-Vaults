# Front-end vs Back-end
---
Why is this Path called “Create a Front-End App with React”? What does that really mean?

The _front-end_ of a web application is the code that a web browser executes. This includes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are rendered by the browser to create the user interface.

The **back-end** of a web application is the code that the server executes. The server stores the data that all of the different clients need, and it listens for requests and sends the requested data back to the client.

In the diagram to the right, the server is represented by the cylinder with three notches. A _server_ is just a specialized computer that is optimized to receive and process requests. One server can handle responses from many different clients, which can be browsers, mobile devices, or any other internet-capable device.

This Skill Path will cover the ins-and-outs of making the front-end of a web application. The front-end is a great place to start learning JavaScript if you want to grow your career because many jobs are front-end focused. Whether you aim to be a software engineer, a product manager, or a technical marketer, a solid understanding of front-end web applications will serve you well!
