When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. Every string instance has a property called `length` that stores the number of characters in that string. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name:

	console.log('Hello'.length); // Prints 5

The `.` is another operator! We call it the _dot operator_.

In the example above, the value saved to the `length` property is retrieved from the instance of the string, `'Hello'`. The program prints `5` to the console, because `Hello` has five characters in it.

To do:
1. Use the `.length` property to log the number of characters in the following string to the console:

		'Teaching the world how to code'
		
Editor content:

	console.log('Teaching the world how to code'.length);
