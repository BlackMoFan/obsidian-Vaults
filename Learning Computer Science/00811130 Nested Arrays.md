# Nested Arrays

---
Earlier we mentioned that arrays can store other arrays. When an array contains another array it is known as a _nested array_. Examine the example below:

```
const nestedArr = [[1], [2, 3]];
```

To access the nested arrays we can use bracket notation with the index value, just like we did to access any other element:

```
const nestedArr = [[1], [2, 3]];

console.log(nestedArr[1]); // Output: [2, 3]
```

Notice that `nestedArr[1]` will grab the element in index 1 which is the array `[2, 3]`. Then, if we wanted to access the elements within the nested array we can _chain_, or add on, more bracket notation with index values.

```
const nestedArr = [[1], [2, 3]]; 

console.log(nestedArr[1]); // Output: [2, 3]
console.log(nestedArr[1][0]); // Output: 2
```

In the second `console.log()` statement, we have two bracket notations chained to `nestedArr`. We know that `nestedArr[1]` is the array `[2, 3]`. Then to grab the first element from that array, we use `nestedArr[1][0]` and we get the value of `2`.

To do:
1. Let’s make a nested array! Create a variable `numberClusters`. Assign as its value an array with three array elements.

	-   The first array element should hold the elements `1` and `2` in that order.
	-   The second array element should hold the elements `3` and `4` in that order.
	-   The third array element should hold the elements `5` and `6` in that order.

2. Awesome, you made a nested array! Now declare a variable named `target` using the `const` keyword and assign to access the element `6` inside `numberClusters`.

	let numberClusters  = [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]];

	const target = numberClusters[2][1];
	console.log(target);
