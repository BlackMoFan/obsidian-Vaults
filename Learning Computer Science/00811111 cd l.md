Our next command is `cd`, which stands for “change directory.” Just as you would click on a folder in Windows Explorer or Finder, `cd` switches you into the directory you specify. In other words, `cd` changes the working directory.

Let’s say the directory we change into is **2015**:

```
$ cd 2015
```

When a file, directory, or program is passed into a command, it is called an _argument_. Here the **2015** directory is an argument for the `cd` command.

The `cd` command takes a directory name as an argument and switches into that directory.

To do:
1. Our current working directory is **/home/ccuser/workspace/blog**. Transfer into the **2015** directory.
2. You should now be in /home/ccuser/workspace/blog/2015 (remember that you can see your working directory at any time using pwd). List the contents of your current directory.
3. Let’s move further into the filesystem. We are currently in the **2015** directory, and we know that it contains a directory named **jan**. **jan** itself contains a directory named **memory**. (You can reference the filesystem for this lesson [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-command-line/img/LCL-fileTrees-01.png).)
	
	Move into **jan** and then into **memory**.
	
	Print the working directory again to see the new location.
