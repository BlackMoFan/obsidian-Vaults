# ls
---
The first command we’re going to look at is `ls`. A _command_ is a directive to the computer to perform a specific task. When you type `ls`, the command line looks at the directory you are in, and then “lists” all the files and directories inside of it. Be sure to type the letter `l` as in “List” and not the number 1.

In the terminal, the first thing you see is `$`. This is called a _shell prompt_. It appears when the terminal is ready to accept a command.

If we typed:
```
$ ls
```
the terminal would display our current directory’s files and directories:

```
2014  2015  hardware.txt
```

The directories **2014**, **2015**, and the file **hardware.txt** are the contents of the current directory.

To do:
1. In the terminal, after the `$`, type:
	
	```
	ls 
	```

	and press enter.

	You should see the three items print out below the command.
